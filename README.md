# openCivV
## Overview
Just a project I started to learn more about java. So far it has no real functionality or anything that would relate it to Civ V, but I'm hoping that as I learn I will be able to expand it into more than it currently is. 

Contributions are welcome, as is advice. You can email me at 2001flyingpigs14@gmail.com with any questions.
## Running
The project runs from the UILoader class. Just navigate within the src folder and compile and run UILoader and you should be good to go.

## Contributing
The project is written in eclipse, purely because this is my IDE of choice for java. You can clone the project within eclipse by going to file > Import > Git> Projects from Git.
