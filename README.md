# openCivV
Just a project I started to learn more about java. So far it has no real functionality or anything that would relate it to Civ V, but I'm hoping that as I learn I will be able to expand it into more than it currently is. 

Contributions are welcome, as is advice. You can email me at 2001flyingpigs14@gmail.com with any questions.

Thanks!
